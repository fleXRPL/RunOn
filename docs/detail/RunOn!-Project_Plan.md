## 9. Communication Plan
- Since garotm is the sole developer, the communication plan will focus on:
  - Maintaining detailed documentation of the development process.
  - Using a project management tool (Trello, Asana, etc.) to track tasks and progress.
  - Regularly seeking feedback from potential users or beta testers.

## 10. Project Success Metrics
- Number of app downloads.
- Active users (daily, monthly).
- User engagement (time spent in-app, features used).
- User reviews and ratings.
- Revenue generated (from in-app purchases).

This comprehensive plan provides a roadmap for the "Run On!" app development.
